Note: The favicon.ico file is a binary file and cannot be directly edited with a text editor. 

The favicon.svg file has been updated with the requested colors (#5B4CC4 and #C12E61) and will be used as the primary favicon for the website. 

For browsers that don't support SVG favicons, you would need to use a tool like:
1. https://realfavicongenerator.net/
2. https://favicon.io/
3. Or a graphics editor like Photoshop, GIMP, or Illustrator

to convert the SVG to ICO format with the appropriate sizes (16x16, 32x32, 48x48).

The SVG favicon has been updated with a gradient from #5B4CC4 to #C12E61, and alternative versions have been created:
- favicon.svg: Main version with gradient
- favicon-solid.svg: Version with solid primary color (#5B4CC4)
- favicon-secondary.svg: Version with solid secondary color (#C12E61)
- favicon-advanced.svg: Version with gradient and subtle pattern overlay
